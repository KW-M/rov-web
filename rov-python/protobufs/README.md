These protocol buffer class files are generated by the betterproto python protobuf compiler from proto definition files in the /shared/protobufs folder.

# [rov_actions_proto](rov_actions_proto.py)

Generated from [rov_actions.proto](../../../shared/protobufs/rov_actions.proto) This is a purely protobuf definition file, and is only used by the websites (no grpc involved).

This protobuf folder in the 'rov-python' folder was used by earlier versions of python code but isn't used anymore.
